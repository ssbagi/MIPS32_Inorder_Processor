# MIPS32_Inorder_Processor

**MIPS 32 Processor**

The MIPS 32 In order 5 stage Pipeline. As part of NPTEL Verilog Course (Week 8 :: Link : https://archive.nptel.ac.in/courses/106/105/106105165/ to https://archive.nptel.ac.in/courses/106/105/106105165/) this project was discussed which givs basic insight of RTL Verilog coding style, basic computer architecture : Pipeline Module. 

The concepts learnt in this are : 
1. The MIPS32 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).
2. MIPS32 Instruction encoding and different Instructions syntax.
3. MIPS32 Addressing Modes.
4. In-Order 5 stage Pipeline : Instruction Fetch,  Decode, Execute, Register Write and Write back stage.
5. The Pipeline hazards found in In-Order Pipeline.
6. Illustrate an example of MIPS32 program. Executing the testbench and simulation results discussion.


**NOTE :**
Most of the time we get ready made IP RTL code delivered from IP Providers (Reduces the design cycle time and makes faster execution of the chips to do early tapeout). If needed we can modify few blocks to meet our expectation. Modify the logic during Synthesis stage or Physical design floks feedback (Tiling time or grouping time).
